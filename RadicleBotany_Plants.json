Bark is grayish-brown, becoming corky and fissured with age. Twigs sometimes develop corky wings.\n\n**Leaves**  \nLeaves are **opposite**, **simple**, **palmately 3\u20135 lobed**, 5\u201310 cm across, with **rounded lobes** and few or no teeth. Lobes are blunt-tipped, separated by shallow sinuses. Leaves are dark green above, paler and softly hairy beneath. Fall color is yellow, sometimes tinged purple.\n\n**Flowers**  \nFlowers appear **with the leaves** in spring, small, **yellow-green**, in erect **corymbs**. Plants are polygamous (male, female, and perfect flowers on same tree). Blooms April\u2013May.\n\n**Fruit**  \nFruit is a paired **samara** with wings spreading **horizontally** (180\u00b0)\u2014nearly in a straight line. Samaras are 2\u20133 cm long, often tinged red.\n\n**Seeds**  \nEach samara contains one seed; wind-dispersed in fall.\n\n**Morphology**  \n**A. campestre** is identified by its **small stature**, **blunt-lobed leaves**, **corky bark**, and **horizontally spreading samara wings**. Distinguished from **A. platanoides** (Norway maple) by smaller size and blunt (not pointed) leaf lobes. The milky sap of Norway maple is absent in field maple.

Native to North America and Eurasia, this species inhabits **ponds, lakes, marshes, and wet meadows**, displaying remarkable variation between aquatic and terrestrial forms.\n\n**Growth habit**\nHighly variable depending on habitat. Aquatic form: stems float on water surface, rooting at nodes, 30\u2013100 cm long. Terrestrial form: erect stems 30\u2013100 cm tall from creeping rhizomes. Plants can transition between forms as water levels change.\n\n**Leaves**\nLeaves are **alternate**, **lanceolate to elliptic**, 5\u201315 cm long. Aquatic leaves are **floating, glossy, smooth, elliptic** with rounded bases. Terrestrial leaves are **narrower, hairy**, with pointed bases. Ocrea (sheath around stem) is present at each node.\n\n**Flowers**\nFlowers are borne in **dense, terminal, spike-like racemes** 2\u20135 cm long, held above water or foliage. Individual flowers are small, with **5 pink tepals**, showy in aggregate. Blooms summer (June\u2013September).\n\n**Fruit**\nFruit is a **lens-shaped achene**, 2\u20133 mm long, dark brown, shiny.\n\n**Seeds**\nAchenes are dispersed by water and waterfowl.\n\n**Morphology**\n**P. amphibia** is identified by its **pink flower spikes**, **dimorphic growth forms**, and **aquatic to wetland habitat**. The dramatic difference between floating and erect forms led early botanists to describe them as separate species. Important waterfowl food. One of the few truly amphibious flowering plants.",
